<font color=white>"TheBalishChannel" has been known for hosting many rants on his livestreams. However, Balish doesn't usually reupload most of these rants to sources other than Twitch. The champ Abomdosnow usually highlights most of these rants, but sometimes the videos become so hated that he either is forced to privatize them, or YouTube ends up taking down the videos entirely. This has caused the rants to be extremely saught after.
<br>
<b>This makes it hard for Youtube Poopers or fans of TheBalishChannel to find what he's most known for.</b>
<p>
However, fret not! A few people have created accounts for the sole reason of reuploading some of Balish's greatest rants.
<p>
<p>
<b>These few accounts specifically host BalishChannel content...</b>
